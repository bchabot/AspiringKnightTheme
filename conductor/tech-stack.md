# Technology Stack: Aspiring Knight WordPress Theme

## Core Backend
- **PHP 8.2+:** Leveraging modern PHP features (typed properties, constructor promotion) for a robust and maintainable codebase.
- **WordPress Core APIs:** Strict adherence to standard WordPress APIs (Customizer, Hooks, Templates) to ensure forward compatibility and performance.
- **Kirki Customizer Framework:** Used to power the comprehensive, component-based Customizer experience, enabling advanced controls for typography, colors, and layout.

## Frontend Development
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and highly optimized, small CSS bundles.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive components like mega menus and dynamic Customizer previews, ensuring a lightweight and modern frontend without unnecessary library bloat.
- **Font Strategy:** Modern implementations of web fonts inspired by medieval calligraphy for headings, paired with high-performance serif fonts for body copy.

## Build & Integration
- **NPM & Webpack/Vite:** For managing frontend assets, processing Tailwind CSS, and bundling JavaScript.
- **Manual Feature Integration:** A "best-of-breed" approach where features from top themes are manually refactored and integrated into our codebase to ensure architectural consistency and performance.
- **Git Version Control:** Following a feature-branch workflow to ensure code quality and stability.
