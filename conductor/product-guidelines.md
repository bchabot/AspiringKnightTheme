# Product Guidelines: Aspiring Knight WordPress Theme

## Content & Editorial
- **Prose Style:** Inspirational and narrative. Focus on storytelling and personal anecdotes to connect with the audience and drive the message of personal growth and discipline.
- **Tone and Voice:** A blend of the **Wise Mentor** and **Brother-in-Arms**. The voice should be authoritative yet encouraging, providing historical wisdom and philosophical insight while remaining grounded in the gritty reality and camaraderie of armored combat.

## Visual & Aesthetic
- **Modern Medievalism:** The design must be responsive, modern, and highly readable.
- **Imagery & Colors:** Incorporate imagery and color palettes inspired by medieval illumination. Use iron grays, golds, and deep reds as primary accents against clean, modern backgrounds.
- **Typography:** Utilize highly readable fonts inspired by High and Late medieval calligraphy (e.g., modern interpretations of Blackletter or Humanist scripts for headers, paired with clear, classic serifs for body text).
- **Thematic Accents:** Use medieval-inspired visual cues (subtle textures, heraldic iconography, or illumination-style borders) strategically to enhance the theme without compromising modern UI/UX standards.

## UI/UX & Interaction
- **Customizer Organization:** Organize the WordPress Customizer into comprehensive, component-based groups (e.g., Global Styles, Header, Footer, Sidebar, Single Post). This allows for a granular yet intuitive customization experience.
- **Professional Defaults:** The theme should ship with "ready-to-use" default configurations that provide an immediately professional and thematic look, while allowing the user to tweak almost any element.
- **Balanced Flexibility:** Ensure that while options are comprehensive, they include "guardrails" (e.g., suggested color pairings or font scales) to help the user maintain a professional aesthetic.
