# Initial Concept

I have a website, https://aspiringknight.com and it needs a make-over. Identify and analyze the top 10 beloved WordPress themes and extract all the best features from them.  We will reporduce those features in a new, Classic WordPress theme for hte Aspiringknight website. Leverage shared code from appropriate open source themes and make do if there is no open source code for a particular feature. Organize Customizer for optimal UI/UX experience. Defaults should produce a ready to use configuration and options should allow the user to tweak just about anything, but the end result should always look professional and appealing.
